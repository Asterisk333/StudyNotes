# Subnetitng

## IP-Address

The IP-Address (ip) is comparable with our home address, it's Unique.  
And just as we have our postal codes ip's have subnets.

## Subnetting

Subnets split a big network into smaller peaces to be more manageable.  
generally the subnetmask is /24 or 255.255.255.0.

## how it works

lets say we have the ip 10.144.101.10. Tis is the ip of our laptop. 
if we have a subnetmask ot /24 this says that the first 24  
Bits of our IP is Locked. mores so this limits our network components to a maximum of 254 (256 - broadcast&Network)

Adding 1 bit to the subnet mask halfs the nbr of possible Netorkdevices.
