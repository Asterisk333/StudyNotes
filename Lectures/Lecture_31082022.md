## Subnetting
Routing is the only way to connect 2 separate networks.  


## GIT
GIT = VCS(Version Control System)
secure previous versions if sth. went wrong --> ability to work together (~1980)

protection against bad coders --> deleting code so on  
everyone is a server, local safes  
central git repo with sync connection --> clones

git repos are Dir trees  

Backup --> git repo with commit every 10 min and push once  
not valid for word so on as full files get  in git --> size and download  to big
