It is easy to get started with Nano! To create or edit a file using nano, we simply use

```
nano filename
```
-- replacing "filename" with the name of the file you wish to edit.

```
tryhackme@linux3:/tmp# nano myfile 
  GNU nano 4.8
                                             myfile                                             Modified
