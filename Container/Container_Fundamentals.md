# Container Fundamentals

## What is a container?

Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment. In this way,
containers virtualize the operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public cloud or even on a
developer’s personal laptop.

## Why use containers?

### Separation of responsibility

Containerization provides a clear separation of responsibility, as developers focus on application logic and
dependencies, while IT operations teams can focus on deployment and management instead of application details such as
specific software versions and configurations.

### Workload portability

Containers can run virtually anywhere, greatly easing development and deployment: on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating
systems; on virtual machines or on physical servers; on a developer’s machine or in data centers on-premises; and of
course, in the public cloud.

### Application isolation

Containers virtualize CPU, memory, storage, and network resources at the operating system level, providing developers
with a view of the OS logically isolated from other applications.

## Container's VS VM's

Like virtual machines, containers allow you to package your application together with libraries and other dependencies,
providing isolated environments for running your software services.

- Containers are much more lightweight than VMs
- Containers virtualize at the OS level while VMs virtualize at the hardware level
- Containers share the OS kernel and use a fraction of the memory VMs require

## Applicatopn points

### Agile development

Containers allow your developers to move much more quickly by avoiding concerns about dependencies and environments.

### Efficient operations
Containers are lightweight and allow you to use just the computing resources you need. This lets you run your
applications efficiently.

### Run anywhere
Containers are able to run virtually anywhere. Wherever you want to run your software, you can use containers.
